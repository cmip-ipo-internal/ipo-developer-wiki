# Usage Statistics 

From a 180 day period at the end of 2023, the login statistics were sampled, providing the findings below.These are just an indicaiton of the userbase - however browsers which inidcated that their user does not want to be tracked did not have entries, so the results presented below are just for reference, and no other usage. 

## Browser
Acknowledging that a single user may use multiple browsers, we normalised the results such that each user-browser combination can only be counted once.

### Browser Breakdown 
Taking the main 4 browser families, we can look into which versions are being used. This gives us information on how up to date the users systems are, and what features their browsers may contain. This can be useful when leveraging new web technologies - e.g. for webgl and visualisation.

## Operating system 
Most browsers / Apps these days are operating system agnostic, however some still have specific limitations. We can see what kind of machine people are using for office based work.

### Splitting Browsers by OS 
Although the most popular OS is Windows, the users seem to be split between Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Out of these it is only Edge the has more Windows users than Mac.
