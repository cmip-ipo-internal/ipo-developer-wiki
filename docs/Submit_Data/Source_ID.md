# Adding a Source ID

???+ warning Content Outdated 

    This content is already outdated. Do not use. 

1. **Prerequisites**: github user-name, ensure that activity id, institutions and license types are registered. 
2. Add model components. 
3. Submit the source ID form to generate a pull request with the relevant data. 



## 1. Prerequisites
### Github Username (optional) 

 Although optional, creating a github username allows us to correctly attribute model and code additions to a person. It also enables them to comment on the relevant (linked) repository updates, issues and discussions around the CMIP6Plus code and usage. 

 Failure to supply a username results in approved commits being attributed to the CMIP-IPO automation process instead. 

### Activity ID
 Please check that your activity appears within [this table](https://airtable.com/embed/appaZflpqbFjA6pwV/shrfJsMoGB0KZ62nN?backgroundColor=purple&layout=card)

 If it does not, it can be added using the form in <link tbc>


### License 
 By default all CMIP tasks should have the CC-by-4.0 license, but occasionally this is not possible. All available licenses are found [here](https://airtable.com/embed/appaZflpqbFjA6pwV/shrTBJ6XwVqfhYbc9?backgroundColor=purple&layout=card). If your required license is not present please create an issue and it can be added to the relevant locations. 


### Institutions and Cohorts
 Validated institutions need to be updated in the [institutions list](https://airtable.com/embed/appaZflpqbFjA6pwV/shrS5whfWbtBD3uEh?backgroundColor=purple&layout=card&viewControls=on). Additional institutions may be added using <link tbc> and require a valid ROR. Go to <link to wiki page> to find out what this is and how to get your institution added. 

 Verified consortiums can be found [here](https://github.com/PCMDI/mip-cmor-tables/blob/main/MIP_consortiums.json) and any missing ones added using <link tbc>.

## 2. Model Components 
 The next step is to ensure that all the relevant model components are located in [the MIP Tables](https://github.com/PCMDI/mip-cmor-tables/blob/main/Auxillary_files/MIP_model_components.json)

 New model components are added using the form [here](https://airtable.com/appaZflpqbFjA6pwV/pagqJEvxGG1SfUgU8/form)
